function corrected_pic = global_background_correction(pic,threshold)
%corrects whole measurement by calculating background mask based on a given threshold on the last frame
%the measurement is then corrected by the average of inverse mask areas (ideally the areas that did not contain cells)
% Input: 
%   pic - the original(uncorrected) measurement data matrix
%   threshold - threshold level that separates cell region from background region on the last frame (pic(:,:,end))
% Returns:
%   corrected_pic - the corrected signal matrix
